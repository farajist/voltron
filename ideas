- It's a framework, but needs more wrapping :
	- GameObject's draw function takes a renderer !
	- TextureManager handles textures through id  
	- 

=> Hide the renderer details from the user of the framework
=> TextureManager gotta handle texture objects (more natural approach)
=> Wrap window related things in a single class
=> Improve the game object (more reading ;) )
=> Ummm well, since it'a a framework ! Why not impose a folder structure ?
	and do auto loading stuff automatically ?
=> Object for other componenents as well
=> BoundingBox instead of x, y ?? From GoF

=> Why the actual fuck we have a LoaderParams class if we're duplicatin them inside SDLGameObject ???

Fifth idea needs some discussion ! But results are the best argument ;)
